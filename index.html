I chose to analyze this webpage because it is affiliated with a book shop that was my absolute favorite store as a child, but the interface itself has some clear issues and is not particularly intuitive.</p>

            IS IT USABLE?
        </div>
        <div>
            We can evaluate the usability of a web page by using three key metrics: learnability, efficiency, and memorability. 
            <ol>
                <li><b>Learnability:</b> How difficult is the system to learn? Can a new user accomplish basic tasks easily?</li>
                <li><b>Efficiency:</b> Can experienced users perform tasks quickly? Is a high level of productivity possible once a user is familiar with the system?</li>
                <li><b>Memorability:</b> How quickly can users reestablish proficiency in the system after a period of not using it?</li>
            </ol>
            Using these metrics, I analyzed the original web page and identified the following key issues.<br><br>
        </div>
        <div class="contents" id="wrappy">
            <div id="big" class="issue">
                <b>MAIN PURPOSE-RELATED</b>
                <ol>
                    <li>The page is generally lacking a clear hierarchical structure that would make it more readable and easy to navigate.</li>
                    <li>For a new or casual user who doesn't have a particular book in mind, this page is a bit intimidating. We can improve this by providing some browsing functionality.</li>
                    <li>The "Buy Indie Online" section's layout and size detracts from the primary goal of this page, which is to find and order a book.</li>

            <div class="issue">

                <ol>
                    <li>The social media links detract from more significant key action options in the header.</li>
                    <li>There is so much information given for each title in the pre-order section that it's tough to just skim the section.</li>

                    <li>There are three search bars which all have the same function. However, the fact that there are three of them makes it seem like they should be used for different things.</li>

            <div class="issue">

                <ol>
                    <li>In the header, the purpose of the search bar and the shopping cart is unclear, since the online shop is only a small part of the overall website.</li>
                    <li>In the footer, the link to shop on kobo is very unintuitive.</li>

                        decreased, the name of the shop and logo get cut off.</li>

            EVALUATING ACCESSIBILITY
        </div>
        <div class="contents">
            <div id="para3">
                We can use the <a href="https://wave.webaim.org" target="_blank">Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool</a> to get a quick overview of possible accessibility concerns that a web page might have. After using this tool
        on the original web page, a number of issues were identified. <br><br>
        The majority of issues involved very low contrast. Although not every example of this seemed like a valid concern to me, the white text on the light blue 
        header, as well as the very light grey links on the white background did lack sufficient contrast to be easily readable. Additionally, the tool 
        identified numerous instances of missing or insufficient alternative text descriptions for images on the web page. Given that these tags are necessary for 
        accessibility tools such as screen readers, I agree that this is a significant accessibility problem.

        After identifying all of the significant usability issues in the original web page, I created wireframes detailing a new design that addressed these issues. I created three wireframes: one for desktop, one for tablet, and one for phone.<br><br>

            HIGH-FIDELITY PROTOTYPES
        </div>
        After deciding on key components and styles, I used Figma to create high-fidelity prototypes for the same three screen sizes 
        as my low-fidelity wireframes. These prototypes contain annotations of key layout choices to make the designs easier to reproduce
        using HTML/CSS.

            Using the final high-fidelity prototypes, I created a new page using HTML and CSS. Note: all buttons and navigational 
            elements on the redesigned page are dummy elements, since I was only doing a single page redesign. Click the link below
